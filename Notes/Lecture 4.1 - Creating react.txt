* So we are going to create the react for ourselves

* Making a folder name custom react

* Making index.html in it, creating root element and then also adding script like vite

* Customreact.js as a script

const mainContainer = document.querySelector('root');

// We created a variable name mainContainer and selected the root element in it

const reactElement = {

}

// Now we are gonna see how react see the html that we return. How it see it after we compile it.


To jo bhi hum return karte hai react unka tree bnane ka try karta hai.

So lets see how react see the element that we return through its inner functions. Suppose we are returning an anchor tag, 

Then it will make an object about it having its details which include its

type: 'a',
props : {
// The properties that we give

href : '',
targget: ''}

children : 'Click to visit gooogle'
}


that is how react compile the element i the tree format for each element that we return

* Now we want a method that return these elements and inject them into root

* To now we have to craete a function that can take these elements from react element and render these elements in root element

* so what we will do is create a function that will take container and react element as a aargument.

* we will make a variable name domElement and create the element uin it using doc.createlement(re.type)

* Then we will add body in it using de.innerHTML = re.children

* then we will set attributeb in it using 

de.sA(re.props.key, re.props.target);

* Then we will append them into container

container.append(domElemnet);



* The function will get complte, now  we will make that function better using loops


* for in loop {

if(prop===children) continue;
de.se(prop, re.props.prop)
}

* This is how react works. Now we will go into vite to understand it better
