* We dont use virtual dom in react these days

* Lets see what createRoot method do in viet

* It created a virtual dom like a browser dom in bg, it compare the main dom and virtual dom and only do update in things that is changed in UI

* While in browser the dom is created all over again with each change and reload

* In virtual dom we can track the whole dom in tree like structure and make the update only in things which is changed

* Lets take an exmple
We have updated a button in dom with another text, lets name this text as a "First change"
And then we make another change in it and name it "Second change". 

So react have to make two change here
1) first change and then change it into second change

* But isnt it possible that react wait for a while before making a change, in that case it dont have to make a first change, it can directly do the second change

* That means we dont have to make any change instantaneously in react
That is why react team thought


* Lets study the React Fibre Architecture

* Virtual dom still exist in react but we update it using fibre algorithm these days

* React phle immediately change karta tha uss sai animation mai kafi effect parta tha, that is why we are using fibre algorithm these days

* Go through the lec video or this github notes to better undeerstand it
