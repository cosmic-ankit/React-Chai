* Creating vite project
* Clearing app.js
* App.jsx -> h1-> Chai aur react
h2 -> Counter value : 5

* Making button for adding value and an another button name remove value

* We have on click method in js to do a action on button

* Making counter value and we will update its value when click on button with a function

* And we have added that variable in jsx which which will display the value of counter in front end

* onClick = {addValue}

const addValue = () => {

console.log(Adding value, math.random()
counter++;
}

* Now when we are clicking the button is working but the value is not updating on counter in webpage

* Now the value of counter is increasing but its not upddating on the jsx counter

* The problem is occuring in ui updation and that is where the real power of react comes in

* Adding counter in add value and remove value and then adding a paragraph and adding the value of counter there too

* Now that is when hooks come in, through hooks we can update the data everywhere when the value of a variabke get updated

* Hooks are methods and they are of various type

* Every hook have his own jobs

* Ui updation is controlled by react

* We get hook from useState, we get use state hook from it

To import hooks

import {useState, useEffect} from 'react'

* use State is responsible to change the state and propogate the change into UI or dom

* useState(default value is given here)

* Through useState we get an array

* the first element is a value (default value) and the second element is a function

const [counter, SetCounter] = useState(15)

* so what hooks do is they update the state and also propogate the changes in UI

* That is why it is called because its react whenever the state or the value of it changes everywhere without writing any code

* Now we will call the setCounter whenever we click on addValue

counter = counter+1
setCounter(counter+1);

* Make a function to decrease the counter

* Assignment =  The last value that can be added is 0 and the highest value that can be attended is 20
