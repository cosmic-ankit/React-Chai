Live Currency Converter
*****************************
*****************************

* Create the tailwind vite app

* Hook is a type of function too. And we can create a custom hook too


****************************************** Custom Hook ***********

* In SRC -> Hooks folder ->useCurrencyInfo.js

(We create a hooks in js because hooks usually in js because they usually return in JS)

* In UCC we will use the custom Hook
UseEffact and UseState


import {useEfeect, useState} from "react"

//Adding use because in hook we usually add Use

//This hook will return the data from the API

* We want to have data when the component is mounted so we will use useEffect

function UCI (currency)
{
const[data,setData] = useState
useEffect(()=>{
fetch(Link of url)

//.then is a function of fetch
.then((res) => res.json())
//It will convert it to json
.then((res) => setData(res[currency]))

}
 [currency])

//Here currency is the dependency, we want to update our data as the currency changes

// We will fetch the api here which gives the currency conversion rate of all the currency for a given currency in link

In the form of a string though it looks like json, so we will cnvert it into json
